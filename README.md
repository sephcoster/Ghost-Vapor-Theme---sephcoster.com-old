###Sephcoster.com Theme Code
The base theme for this blog was [Vapor by Seth Lilly](https://github.com/sethlilly/Vapor).

I've customized it a bit to suit my tastes, including adding the menu bar (already in there but uncommented and set up in the partials) as well as adjusting some of the spacing and styling.
